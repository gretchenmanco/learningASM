 EE 380 Time Delay Homework 
Problem 1: Find the time delay for the delay subroutine below if the system has a PIC18 with a frequency of 4 MHz: 
MOVLW D’200’ 
MOVWF REGA 
BACK MOVLW D’250’ 
MOVWF REGB 
HERE NOP 
DECF REGB 
BNZ HERE 
DECF REGA 
BNZ BACK 


Problem 2: Find the time delay for the delay subroutine below if the system has a PIC18 with a frequency of 10 MHz: 
MOVLW D’200’ 
MOVWF REGA 
BACK MOVLW D’100’ 
MOVWF REGB 
NOP 
NOP 
NOP 
HERE DECF REGB,F 
BNZ HERE 
DECF REGA,F 
BNZ BACK 


Problem 3: For the code below, calculate the time required to execute the code if the system has a PIC18 with frequency 16MHz. Also, find the value in L_Byte and H_Byte at the end of execution 
L_Byte EQU 0x5 
H_Byte EQU 0x6 
ORG 0h 
MOVLW 0x0 
MOVWF H_Byte 
ADDLW 0x79 
BNC N_1 
INCF H_Byte,F 
N_1 ADDLW 0xF5 
BNC N_2 
INCF H_Byte,F 
N_2 ADDLW 0xE2 
BNC OVER 
INCF H_Byte,F 
OVER MOVWF L_Byte 
END 


Problem 4: Suppose you have a PIC18 with a frequency of 16MHz. You are writing code to blink the LED’s on Port B bits 0-4.
It is required to have a 1 second time delay between each change of LED’s.
Write the delay subroutine in assembly to achieve this time delay. 
Be sure to pay attention to the maximum numbers you can use for each loop counter.

# TO DO:
# Write a program to monitor the RE0 bit.  
# When it (RE0) is HIGH, send 99H to PORT B
# When it (RE0) is LOW, send 66H to PORTC.

# Consider doing this as a flowchart (almost as if I would program this example in C)
# For Dr. W use the following for FC's: Rect = Statement /  Diamond = Condition  /  Ellipse = Start/Stop  / flow vertically

# Example to find the time it takes to execute this set of instructions using my PIC
# 16 MHz crystal
# Every oscillation cycle takes 4 instruction cycles
# 16MHz/4 = 4MHz that is 4 oscillations per one instruction cycle
# 1/4MHz = time per instruction cycle
#Totoal Instructions = 3016
# 3016/(4*10^6Hz) = 7.54*10^-4 seconds
# RECALL!!!  Essentially I am moving the bits in the register....consider this

# ***Next trial:  create an example so that there is a second between the blinks.
# ***Next trial:  there is a limit to the maximum value that I can input for the time delay because this is an 8-bit chip
